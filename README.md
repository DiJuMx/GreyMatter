# Grey Matter

Grey Matter is intended to be an extensible neural network library written in C.

It is *not* intended to be:
* Fast
* Memory Efficient
* User Friendly

There are likely many bugs and issues with this fledgling project.
In addition, the API is not guaranteed to be stable.

## Everything is a Unit

In Grey Matter, almost everything is a "Unit".

A Unit is effectively a black box system consisting of:
* An array of outputs
* An array of pointers to inputs
* A functional body
